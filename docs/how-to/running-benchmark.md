# Running the benchmark

Depending on the job, there should be a single entry point for running the benchmark in `$(base_dir)/$(output_dir)`. For example, there will be a `start.py` for a [Sequential Job](#). Just run this script to run the whole benchmark.

```sh
./benchmarks/.../output/.../start.py
```
