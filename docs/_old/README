Structure
---------
bgen  - creates start scripts
beval - evaluates solver runs
bconv - transforms output of eval into spreadsheets

benchmarks/ - example benchmarks
doc/        - documentation
output/     - default output folder for the examples
programs/   - should contain solver/tool executables
runscripts/ - contains example run-scripts
src/        - Python source files
templates/  - contains example call-scripts

Prerequisites
-------------
- lxml (http://codespeak.net/lxml/)
- >= python-2.6

Example 1
---------
The first example assumes that you want to run a benchmark that
shall be started using simple bash scripts. All the following 
instruction assume that the current working directory is the 
root directory of the benchmark-tool project. To begin, the two
executables clasp-1.3.2 [1] and runsolver-3.2.5 [2]. have to be
copied (or symlinked) into the ./programs folder.
Now, run:
	./bgen ./runscripts/runscript-seq.xml
This creates a set of start scripts in the ./output folder.
To start the benchmark, run:
	./output/clasp-big/houat/start.py
Once the benchmark is finished, run:
	./beval ./runscripts/runscript-seq.xml | ./bconv > result.ods
Finally, open the file:
	soffice result.ods

Example 2
---------
The second example assumes that you want to run a benchmark on 
a cluster using mpi. The example is tailored to the intel-MPI
implementation running on the zuse cluster [3] at the university
of Potsdam. Again, all the following instruction assume that the 
current working directory is the root directory of the 
benchmark-tool project. To begin, an executable of the parallel 
solver claspar-2.1.0 [4] has to be copied (or symlinked) into the
./programs folder.
Note that there is only python-2.4 installed on zuse. You either 
have to run the scripts bgen, beval, and bconv on systems with a 
newer python version installed, or alternatively, you can use my 
local python-3.1 installation; simply add it to your path:
	/home/kaminski/local/python3/bin

Now, run:
	./bgen ./runscripts/runscript-pbs.xml
This creates a set of start scripts in the ./output folder.
To start the benchmark, run (on the cluster):
	./output/claspar-one-as/zuse/start.sh
Once the benchmark is finished, run:
	./beval ./runscripts/runscript-pbs.xml | ./bconv > result.ods
Finally, open the file:
	soffice result.ods
