- sequential
  - compare different systems with different settings
    - most important for ben
	-> a runscript should provide the possibility to 
	   easyly run all systems with all settings
  - compare different machines
    - not yet important
	- allow for specifying multiple machines
	- easy to implement
	  -> create one start script per machine

- parallel
  - compare different systems with different settings
  - comparing clusters doesn't seem important to me 
    -> but is possible using the mechanism described above
  - mixing sequential and parallel settings makes no sense
    -> the sequential reference solver can always be started using pbs

- think about
  - group run specs into projects
    -> all jobs in a project should be startable by a single start script (per machine)
  - the current runall is problematic
    -> provide tags to tag settings that are
	-> to enable runall functionality provide the predifined tag "*all*"
