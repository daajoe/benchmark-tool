Structure
---------
bgen  - creates start scripts
beval - evaluates solver runs
bconv - transforms output of eval into spreadsheets

benchmarks/ - example benchmarks
doc/        - documentation
output/     - default output folder for the examples
programs/   - should contain solver/tool executables
runscripts/ - contains example run-scripts
src/        - Python source files
templates/  - contains example call-scripts

Prerequisites
-------------
- lxml (http://codespeak.net/lxml/)
- python 2.6

Example
-------
All the following instruction assume that the current working
directory is the root directory of the benchmark-tool project.
To begin, the two executables clasp-1.3.2 and runsolver-3.2.5.
have to be copied (or symlinked) into the ./programs folder.
Now, run:
	./bgen ./runscripts/runscript-big.xml
This creates a set of start scripts in the ./output folder.
To start the benchmark, run:
	./output/clasp-big/houat/start.py
Once the benchmark is finished, run:
	./beval ./runscripts/runscript-big.xml | ./bconv > result.ods
Finally, open the file:
	soffice result.ods
